# React/Node/Express Sandbox

This repo is a bare-bones React/Node/Express application that can serve as a starting point for your sandboxing.

```
npm install
```

### In two separate terminals:
```
npm run build
```

```
npm start
```

### Store each sandbox on a separate branch:
```
git checkout -b branch-name
```
