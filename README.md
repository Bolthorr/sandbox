# React/Node/Express Sandbox

This repo is a bare-bones React/Node/Express application that can serve as a starting point for your sandboxing.

```
npm install
```

### In two separate terminals:
```
npm run build
```

```
npm start
```

### Store each project on a separate branch so that you can always start fresh with a clean sandbox:
```
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```
